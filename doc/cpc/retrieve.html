It is possible to make IvyDE copy the resolved dependencies in your project: a retrieve of the dependencies can be triggered on each resolve of the classpath container.

To enable it, enter the classpath container configuration panel, and hit the second tab "Retrieve".

<center><img src="../images/retrieve.jpg"/></center>

So you can choose to <b>do retrieve after resolve</b> the dependencies.

The <b>Retrieve pattern</b> specified the location where the deendencies should be copied, location raltive to the containing project.

The <b>Delete old retrieved artifacts</b> check box will enable the wipe out the output directory before each retrieve.

And finally you can select in which <b>Configurations</b> the dependencies should be resolved and you can select which <b>Types</b> of artifact should be actually retrieved. In both fields, <i>*</i> will means <i>all</i>.
