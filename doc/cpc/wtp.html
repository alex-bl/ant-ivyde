WTP is the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Web Tools Platform</a> project from the Eclipse fondation which allow to easily develop, launch and debug web applications. IvyDE can be used with this framework, but only from the version 2.0 of WTP, which is supported since Eclipse 3.3.

In the properties of your project configured to use WTP, there is a section "Java EE Module Dependencies". There should be your configured IvyDE classpath container listed, usually with the name "ivy.xml [*]". Just select it and the Ivy dependencies will be deployed as well.

This has been successfully tested with Eclipse 3.3 and WTP 2.0, Eclipse 3.4 and WTP 3.0.
