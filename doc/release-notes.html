<h1><a name="annoucement"></a>Release Annoucement</h1>

<tt>
The Apache IvyDE project is pleased to announce its 2.2.0 release.

The Apache IvyDE Eclipse plugin integrates Apache Ivy's dependency management into Eclipse. It lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of project which needs dependency management. Apache IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but not least Apache IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion. Get some preview here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/screenshots.html

Major changes in this release:
* the API of IvyDE has been stabilized so that third party plugins can rely on it,
* while still not complete, and still not advertised as stable in Ivy, support of OSGi has been added,
* javadoc and source attachement can be edited now one by one,
* improved stability of the resolve process,
* improved logging for easier debugging.

Compatibility:
* this release is expected to work with every version of Ivy 2.1 or superior. The OSGi features require Ivy 2.3.0 or superior though.

This release is considered as stable. The beta of 2.2.0 has been out for a (too) long time.

A more detailed release notes can be read there:

<h1><a name="what"></a>What is Apache IvyDE?</h1>

Apache IvyDE is the Eclipse plugin which integrates Apache Ivy's dependency management into Eclipse&#153;.

Apache IvyDE lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of project which needs dependency management. Apache IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but not least Apache IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion. Get some preview here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/screenshots.html.

<h1><a name="status"></a>Status of this release</h1>

This release is considered as stable. The beta of 2.2.0 has been out for a (too) long time.

<h1><a name="majorchanges"></a>Major Changes in this Release</h1>

The API of IvyDE has been stabilized so that third party plugins can rely on it. The developper community will now ensure that the non "internal" packages will be kept backward compatible.

While it is still not advertised as stable in Ivy, some support of OSGi has been added. IvyDE can now read the OSGi metadata on the dependencies being resolved and setup the proper access rules. It doesn't work with the workspace resolver yet (see IVYDE-350).

IvyDE is automatically mapping sources and javadocs to resolved jars. But now for edge cases, it is possible to override the default mapping and edit the javadoc and source attachement jar by jar.

The resolve process, the heart of IvyDE features, has been even more stabilized and improved. For instance, now at Eclipse startups IvyDE is far less required to launch a resolve of the classpaths; the previous state of the classpath containers are saved between Eclipse sessions.

IvyDE now have its own logging channel. In the Ivy console, different levels can be chosen on how IvyDE itself is logging about the resolve processes.
